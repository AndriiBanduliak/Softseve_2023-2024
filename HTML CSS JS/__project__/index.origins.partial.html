            The quality of our tobacco is determined by the composition of the seeds, the soil, climatic conditions, 
            the curing and fermentation processes and the skill with which the tobacco is handled. As tobacco is a 
            natural product, its quality and flavor can differ from one year to another. The country and the region also matter. 
            The tobacco produced in Cuba is known for its aromatic properties.

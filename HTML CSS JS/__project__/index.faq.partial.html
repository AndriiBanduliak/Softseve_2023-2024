              Wider cigars are generally a mellower smoke. A narrow cigar has a
              slightly higher burn temperature and its flavor is dominated by
              the wrapper, which results in a stronger-tasting smoke. The length
              of a cigar also affects your experience.

              Tobacco has been grown in Cuba for hundreds of years, and
              manufacturers have been making cigars in this country since the
              time of Phillip II of Spain. In Cuba, there is the perfect
              combination of climate, tobacco leaf quality and the availability
              of modern technologies.

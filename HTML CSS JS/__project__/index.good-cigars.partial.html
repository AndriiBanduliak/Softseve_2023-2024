        Our modern and well-equipped cigar factories in Cuba do not rely solely
        on technologies. On the contrary, the making of cigars still requires
        human skills. Our employees are engaged in a craft and are supported by
        modern technologies.

        QUALITY THAT CAN'T BE OVERESTIMATED
      </h3>
      <p class="good-cigars-seed-quality__description">
        Before a wrapper is wound around a cigar, it passes through at least
        three hundred pairs of hands. You can trace the journey of your cigar
        from the tobacco leaf or even seed to the boxed cigar. We use the most
        modern approaches and only natural ingredients.

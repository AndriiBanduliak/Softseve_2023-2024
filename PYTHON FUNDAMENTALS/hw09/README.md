# TASK 1

Write a Python program that randomly generates a number from a range of 1 to 100 and asks the user to guess that number in 10 tries.

## Game Rules

- The program reads the numbers entered by the user.
- It prompts the user whether the guessed number is greater or less than the number entered by the user.
- The game continues until the user has used 10 attempts and guessed the number.
- If the user guesses the number, the program prints a congratulatory message.
- If 10 attempts have been exhausted and the user did not guess the number, then the corresponding message is displayed.

## Note

To perform this task, you need to import the random module, and from it the `randint()` function.

# TASK 2

You need to change the code in the `Rect_pygame.py` program so that the rectangle does not extend beyond the program window.

## File Location

The file `Rect_pygame.py` is in this directory.

# TASK 3

You need to combine two programs, `OWM.py` and `Tk_OWM.py`, into one working program.

## File Location

The files `OWM.py` and `Tk_OWM.py` are in this directory.

# Programming Tasks

## TASK 1

Write a program that prompts the user to enter their age, and then displays a message stating whether the age is even or odd. The program must provide the ability to enter a negative number, and in this case generate an exception. The master code should call a function that processes the information entered.

## TASK 2

Write a program that analyzes the entered number and, depending on the number, gives the day of the week that corresponds to this number (1 is Monday, 2 is Tuesday, etc.). Take into account cases of entering numbers from 8 and more, as well as cases of entering non-numerical data.

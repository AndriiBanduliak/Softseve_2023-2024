# Task1. "Temperature Converter"

Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a temperature in Celsius and then converts it to Fahrenheit using the formula: F = (C * 9/5) + 32. Your program should then print out the converted temperature in Fahrenheit.

However, if the user enters a temperature below -273.15°C (the lowest possible temperature in the universe, also known as absolute zero), your program should print an error message instead of attempting to convert the temperature.

Note: You can assume that the user will enter a valid input (a number for the temperature in Celsius).

Example output:
Enter the temperature in Celsius: 25
25°C is equivalent to 77°F

Example output (if the user enters a temperature below absolute zero):
Enter the temperature in Celsius: -300
Error: Temperature below absolute zero (-273.15°C)

# Task: Are You Playing Banjo?

## Description
Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

- name + " plays banjo" 
- name + " does not play banjo"

Names given are always valid strings.


# Task: Convert a Number to a String!
## Description
We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.

What ways of achieving this do you know?

## Examples (input --> output)
- 123  --> "123"
- 999  --> "999"
- -100 --> "-100"

## Description
Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).


# Task: Find The Distance Between Two Points

## Description
Given two ordered pairs calculate the distance between them. Round to two decimal places. This should be easy to do in 0(1) timing.


# Task: Is this my tail?

## Description
Some new animals have arrived at the zoo. The zoo keeper is concerned that perhaps the animals do not have the right tails. To help her, you must correct the broken function to make sure that the second argument (tail), is the same as the last letter of the first argument (body) - otherwise the tail wouldn't fit!

If the tail is right return true, else return false.

The arguments will always be non empty strings, and normal letters.

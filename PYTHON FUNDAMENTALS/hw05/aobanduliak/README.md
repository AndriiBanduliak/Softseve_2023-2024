# Programming Tasks

## Task 1
- Create a list that contains elements of integer type.
- Use the loop to change the type of these elements to a floating type.
- Hint: use the built-in float() function.

## Task 2
- Print Fibonacci numbers up to the entered number n, using cycles.
- Sequence of Fibonacci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.

## Task 3
- Write a script that will calculate the factorial of the entered number without using recursion.
- Example:  
    - 0! = 1
    - 1! = 1
    - 2! = 2
    - 3! = 1*2*3 = 6
    - etc.
